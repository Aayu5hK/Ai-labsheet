# Vacuum Cleaning Agent Simulations

Three types of intelligent agents were implemented to solve the vacuum cleaning problem:

---

## ðŸ§¹ Simple Reflex Agent
**Behavior**: Reacts only to current cell state  
**Decision Making**:  
- If dirty â†’ Sucks  
- If clean â†’ Moves randomly

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal-Based Agent 
**Behavior**: Maintains world model to achieve complete cleanliness  
**Features**:  
- Tracks all dirty cells  
- Moves systematically to nearest dirty cell  
- Stops when all clean

## ðŸ“Š Utility-Based Agent
**Behavior**: Maximizes performance measure  
**Utility Function**:  
- +5 for cleaning  
- -1 per move  
- -2 for idling  
- -1 per remaining dirty cell
